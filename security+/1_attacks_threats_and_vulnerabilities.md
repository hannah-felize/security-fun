organization to disclose the collected data publicly for the purpose of chaining the perception of the target

**Understand hybrid warfare.** Hybrid warfare is the combine of classical military strategy
with modern capabilities, including digital influence campaigns, psychological warfare efforts, political tactics, and cyber warfare capabilities. It is also known as nonlinear warfare.

**Understand principles of social engineering.** Many techniques are involved in social engineering attacks. These often involve one or more common principles such as authority,
intimidation, consensus/social proof, scarcity, familiarity/liking, trust, and urgency.

# 1.2 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators to determine the type of attack.

**Understand malware.** Malware or malicious code is any element of software that performs an unwanted function from the perspective of the legitimate user or owner of a computer system.

**Understand ransomware.** Ransomware is a form of malware that takes over a computer
system, usually by encrypting user data, to hinder its use while demanding payment.

**Understand Trojan.** A Trojan or Trojan horse is a means of delivering malicious software
by disguising inside of something useful or legitimate.

**Understand worms.** Worms are designed to exploit a specific vulnerability in a system and
then use that flaw to replicate themselves to other systems. Worms typically focus on replication and distribution, rather than on direct damage and destruction.

**Understand PUPs.** Potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) are any type of questionable
software. Anything that is not specifically malware but still otherwise unwanted on a typical computer system could be considered a PUP.

**Understand fileless virus.** Fileless viruses reside in memory only and do not save themselves to the local storage devices.

**Understand command and control.** Command and control (C&C) is an intermediary
communication service often used by botnets.

commercial code that collects information about users without their direct knowledge or
permission.

**Understand adware.** Adware displays pop-up or alternate advertisements to users based
on their activities, URLs they have visited, applications they have accessed, and so on.

**Understand keyloggers.** A keylogger is a form of unwanted software that records the keystrokes typed into a system’s keyboard.

**Understand a RAT.** A remote-access Trojan (RAT) is a form of malicious code that grants
an attacker some level of remote-control access to a compromised system.

**Understand rootkits.** A rootkit is a special type of hacker tool that embeds itself deep
within an operating system (OS), where it can manipulate information seen by the OS and
displayed to users.

**Understand backdoor attacks.** There are two types of backdoor attacks: a developerinstalled access method that bypasses any and all security restrictions, or a hacker-installed
remote-access client.

**Understand password attacks.** Password attacks are collectively known as password
cracking or password guessing. Forms of password attacks include brute force (also known
as a birthday attack), dictionary, hybrid, and rainbow tables.

**Understand spraying and stuffing.** Spraying or stuffing of passwords/credentials is the
attempt to log into a user account through repeated attempts of submitting generated or
pulled-from-a-list credentials.

**Understand dictionary attacks.** A dictionary attack performs password guessing by using
a preexisting or precompiled list of possible passwords.

**Understand brute-force attacks.** A brute-force attack tries every valid combination of
characters to construct possible passwords.

**Understand online vs. offline password cracking.** An online password attack occurs
against a live logon prompt. An offline attack is one where the attacker is working on their
own independent computers to compromise a password hash.

**Understand rainbow tables.** Rainbow tables take advantage of a concept known as a hash
chain. It offers relatively fast password cracking, but at the expense of spending the time
and effort beforehand to craft the rainbow table hash chain database.

**Understand malicious USB cables and flash drives.** A malicious universal serial bus (USB)
cable or flash drive is a device crafted to perform unwanted activities against a computer
and/or mobile device or peripheral without the victim realizing the attack is occurring.
Attacks include exfiltrating data and injecting malware.

**Understand card cloning and skimming.** Card cloning is the duplication of data
(skimming) from a targeted source card onto a blank new card.

**Understand adversarial AI.** Adversarial artificial intelligence (AI) (AAI) or adversarial
machine learning (ML) (AML) is a training or programming technique where computational systems are set up to operate in opposition to automate the process of developing
system defenses and attacks. This is also called a generative adversarial network (GAN).

**Understand supply-chain attacks.** Supply chain attacks could result in flawed or less reliable products or could allow for remote access or listening mechanisms to be embedding
into otherwise functioning equipment.

**Understand birthday attacks.** Birthday attacks (a.k.a. brute force) are used against hashing
and other forms of cryptography involving finite sets (of either hashes or keys).

**Understand collision.** A collision is when the output of two cryptography operations produces the same result.

**Understand a downgrade attack.** A downgrade attack attempts to prevent a client from
successfully negotiating robust high-grade encryption with a server

# 1.3 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators associated with application attacks.

**Understand arbitrary code execution.** Arbitrary code execution is the ability to run any
software on a target system.

**Understand privilege escalation.** Privilege escalation occurs when a user account is able to
obtain unauthorized access to higher levels of privileges.

**Understand cross-site scripting.** Cross-site scripting (XSS or CSS) is a form of malicious
code injection attack in which an attacker is able to compromise a web server and inject
their own malicious code into the content sent to other visitors.

**Understand cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention.** The most effective ways to prevent XSS
on a resource host are implemented by the programmer by validating input, coding defensively, escaping metacharacters, and rejecting all script-like input.

**Understand metacharacters.** Metacharacters are characters that have been assigned
special programmatic meaning. Escaping a metacharacter is the process of marking the
metacharacter as merely a normal or common character, thus removing its special programmatic powers.

**Understand injection attacks.** An injection attack is any exploitation that allows an
attacker to submit code to a target system to modify its operations and/or poison and corrupt its data set. Examples include SQL injection, DLL injection, LDAP injection, XML
injection, command injection, code injection, HTML injection, and file injection.

**Understand command injection.** A command injection attack focuses on executing
malicious commands on a vulnerable target system.

**Understand code injection.** Code injection adds malicious code to an existing script or
application.

**Understand HTML injection.** HTML injection is effectively an XSS event, but instead of
using JavaScript or other code, it plants custom HTML statements.

**Understand file injection.** File injection attempts to deposit a file on a target system.

**Understand SQL injection.** SQL injection (SQLi) attacks allow a malicious individual
to perform SQL transactions directly against the backend database through a website
front end.

**Understand DLL injection.** Dynamic-link library (DLL) injection or DLL hijacking is an
advanced software exploitation technique that manipulates a process’s memory to trick
it into loading additional code and thus performing operations the original author did
not intend.

**Understand LDAP injection.** Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) injection is an
input injection attack against a LDAP directory service.

**Understand XML injection.** XML injection is another variant of SQL injection, where the
backend target is an XML application.

**Understand pointer dereference.** Pointer dereferencing or object dereference is the programmatic activity of retrieving the value stored in a memory location by triggering the
pulling of the memory based on its address or location as stored in a pointer.

**Understand directory traversal.** A directory traversal is an attack that enables an attacker
to jump out of the web root directory structure and into any other part of the filesystem
hosted by the web server’s host OS.

**Understand buffer overflows.** A buffer overflow is a memory exploitation that takes
advantage of a software’s lack of input length validation. Some buffer overflows can allow
for arbitrary code execution.
Know about DEP. Data execution prevention (DEP) is a memory security feature of many
operating systems aimed at blocking a range of memory abuse attacks, including buffer
overflows. DEP blocks the execution of code stored in areas of memory designated as dataonly areas.

**Understand ASLR.** Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is a memory
management mechanism that ensures that the various elements and components of the
OS and other core system code are loaded into randomly assigned memory locations at
each bootup.

**Know about unbounded C++ functions.** The C++ unbounded functions to know are
strcat(), strcpy(), sprintf(), vsprintf(), memcpy(), bcopy(), getwd(), scanf(), and gets(). If you
see these functions in a C++ program, especially simple ones with only a few lines of code,
then usually a buffer overflow vulnerability is present.

**Understand race conditions.** A race condition attack is the manipulation of the completion order of tasks to exploit a vulnerability.

**Understand TOCTOU.** Time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU or TOC/TOU) attacks
are often called race condition attacks because the attacker is racing with the legitimate
process to replace the object before it is used.

**Comprehend error handling.** When a process, a procedure, or an input causes an error,
the system should revert to a more secure state.

**Understand improper error handling.** Improper error handling may allow for the leaking of essential information to attackers or enable attackers to force a system into an insecure state.

\*\*Know proper input handling. Input handling or filtering should include the following:
check for length, filter for known malware patterns, and escape metacharacters.

**Understand improper input handling.** Improper input handling occurs when an application is designed to simply accept whatever data is submitted as input. Only with proper
input handling can software exploitation be reduced or eliminated.

**Understand a replay attack.** In a replay attack, an attacker captures network traffic and
then replays (retransmits) the captured traffic in an attempt to gain unauthorized access
to a system.

**Understand wireless replay attacks.** Wireless replay attacks may focus on initial authentication abuse. They may be used to simulate numerous new clients or cause a DoS.

**Understand session replay.** A session replay is the recording of a subject’s visit to a website, interacting with a mobile application, or using an PC application, which is then played
back by an administrator, investigator, or programmer to understand what occurred and
why based on the subject’s activities.

**Understand integer overflow.** An integer overflow is the state that occurs when a
mathematical operation attempts to create a numeric value that is too large to be contained
or represented by the allocated storage space or memory structure.

**Understand request forgeries.** Request forgeries are exploitations that make malicious
requests of a service in such a way that the request seems legitimate. There are two primary
types of request forgeries: server-side and cross-site.

**Understand SSRF.** Server-side request forgery (SSRF) is when a vulnerable server is
coerced into functioning as a proxy.

**Understand cross-site request forgery (XSRF).** Cross-site request forgery (XSRF or CSRF)
tricks the user or the user’s browser into performing actions they had not intended or
would not have authorized.

**Understand API attacks.** Application programming interface (API) attacks are malicious
usages of software through its API.

**Understand resource exhaustion.** Resource exhaustion occurs when applications are
allowed to operate in an unrestricted and unmonitored manner so that all available system
resources are consumed in the attempt to serve the requests of valid users or in response to
a DoS attack.

**Understand memory leaks.** A memory leak occurs when a program fails to release
memory or continues to consume more memory.

**Understand SSL stripping.** SSL stripping is an on-path attack that prevents the negotiation of strong encryption between a client and server. Early attacks blocked access to
HTTPS, later versions proxied between HTTP and HTTPS, and current versions perform
downgrade attacks on the cipher suits of SSL/TLS.

**Understand driver manipulation.** Driver manipulation occurs when a malicious programmer crafts a system or device driver so that it behaves differently based on certain conditions. Driver manipulation may be used to achieve a specific goal or hide the fact that a
specific goal is not being met.

**Understand shimming.** Shimming is a means of injecting alternate or compensation code
into a system to alter its operations without changing the original or existing code.

**Understand refactoring.** Refactoring is a restricting or reorganizing of software code
without changing its externally perceived behavior or produced results.

**Understand pass the hash.** Pass the hash is an authentication attack that potentially can
be used to gain access as an authorized user without actually knowing or possessing the
plaintext of the victim’s credentials. This attack is mostly aimed at Windows systems.
